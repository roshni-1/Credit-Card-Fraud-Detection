# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, various techniques were used to balance the data and optimize the detection model. The ensemble model combines multiple classifiers to improve prediction accuracy.
